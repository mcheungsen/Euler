# Euler

_Solving problems from [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/)_

## 🔌 Dynamic Class Loading

Each problem is implemented in an individual class named `ProblemX`. Each of these classes implements the `EulerProblem` interface, containing the `solve()` method to solve each Euler problem. Each class will be implemented as needed.

### ✅ Advantages

-   This system allows for simple addition of new problems by creating a new class with its associated number.
-   Avoids code duplication by using a single common interface.

### 🛠️ How to Use

-   The main program includes a scanner. Simply enter the number of the problem you wish to solve.
-   The class corresponding to the problem will be compiled and executed.
